# GPT-based Chatbot with Enhanced Knowledge Base

This project involves the implementation of a chatbot based on ChatGPT that leverages a custom knowledge base, thus expanding its capabilities for answering questions. 
The chatbot utilizes "in-context learning" to infer knowledge from external data sources.

OpenAI API, LlamaIndex, and LangChain were utilized to implement this project.
